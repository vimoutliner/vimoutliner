----------------------------
revision 1.11
date: 2003-09-05 16:37:55 +0000;  author: cepl;  state: Exp;  lines: +41 -2
Added ,cp binding for the new function InsertCheckBoxPerCent,
which adds not only the checkbox but also percentage sign.
----------------------------
revision 1.10
date: 2003-08-23 16:42:15 +0000;  author: noel;  state: Exp;  lines: +18 -17
Modified completion percentages to be recursive.
This:
[_] 0% Project
	[_] 33% Task
		[_] Subtask
		[X] Subtask
		[X] Subtask
	[_] 0% Task
		[_] Subtask
		[_] 50% Subtask
			[X] Subsubtask
			[_] Subsubtask
			[X] Subsubtask
			[_]  Subsubtask

revision 1.9
date: 2003-08-16 13:49:53 +0000;  author: noel;  state: Exp;  lines: +9 -7

----------------------------
revision 1.7
date: 2003-08-03 23:56:46 +0000;  author: noel;  state: Exp;  lines: +89 -40

Replaced HowManyDone() with a new routine. The new routine is recursive,
ignores headings that don't have checkboxes and does not care what the
current folding states of the parent or children are. The heading at the
top of the tree does not even need to have a checkbox. This will work:

Projects
	[_] Software
		[_] Input
		[_] Processing
			[_] Math
			[_] Database
			[_] Networking
		[_] Output
	[_] Hardware
		[_] Keyboard
		[_] Harddisk
		[_] Processor
		[_] Printer

One only needs to ,,cx on Projects to update everything (everything shown).
As before, including a % on a parent heading with childred, will be replaced
with a percentage of completion. Nice work Matej!
----------------------------
