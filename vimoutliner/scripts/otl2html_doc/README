The html files have been created with these commands:

otl2html.py -S -D webpage.css demo.otl > demo.html
otl2html.py -S -D webpage.css demo1.otl > demo1.html
otl2html.py -S -D webpage.css demo2.otl > demo2.html
otl2html.py -S -D webpage.css demo3.otl > demo3.html
otl2html.py -S nnnnnn.css party.otl > party.html
otl2html.py -S nnnnnn.css otl2html.otl > otl2html.html

This is the last of the 1.xx series of otl2html.py. It's internal logic has
become complex and unwieldy. It is being rewritten from the ground up to
be:
	recursive
	much simpler
	use configuration files

It will suport:
	table of contents generation
	slide shows
	better general document authoring
	better web page authoring
	web site authoring

Have fun!
