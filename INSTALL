Automatic Method

The automatic installation targets Unix-compatible platforms:

From tar archive

    $ tar xzvf vimoutliner-0.3.x.tar.gz
    $ cd vimoutliner
    $ sh install.sh

From zip archive 

    $ unzip vimoutliner-0.3.x.zip
    $ cd vimoutliner-0.3.x
    $ sh install.sh 

Installing with pathogen

If you have pathogen installed as your package manager you can clone the git repository in you
pathogen directory:
        $ cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner.git

Installing using install.sh:

First you can decide whether to install the VimOutliner files or abort the
process leaving everything unchanged.  Assuming you confirmed the
installation, the script creates the necessary directory tree and copies the
files which provide the core functionality and documentation.

With the second question you decide whether you want to install some brand new
add-ons, currently implementing checkboxes(enabled), hoisting(disabled) 
and smart paste(disabled), as well as several useful external scripts in the vimoutliner/scripts folder.


Updating

Updating an existing installation might require some manual work.

If you are already working with a previous VimOutliner release, there is a
slight chance that the current directory tree is different from your current
one. In this case, you will have to manually migrate your files to the new
locations.

The installation script creates unique backups of files being replaced with
newer versions. So if you put some local customisations into, say
$HOME/.vim/vimoutliner/vimoutlinerrc, you'll probably have to merge the backup
with the new file by hand.


Manual Method

You can also copy the files from the unpacked distribution tarball into their
destination folders by yourself. The following steps are a description of what
has to go where and assume some knowledge of your vim setup.

If you encounter problems, please contact the mailing list for an immediate
solution and more complete future documentation.  www.lists.vimoutliner.org

If you want to setup VimOutliner on a system running Microsoft Windows, the
directory $HOME denotes the base folder of the vim installation.  If you're on
Unix based system, $HOME is as usual.

You need the following sub trees in your $HOME directory:

    $HOME/.vim/
        doc/
        ftdetect/
        ftplugin/
        syntax/
        vimoutliner/
            plugins/
            scripts/

The distribution tarball unpacks into a directory vimoutliner with the
following contents:

    vimoutliner/
        plugins/             (1)
        scripts/             (1)
    doc/                     (1)
    ftdetect/                (1)
    ftplugin/                (1)
    install.sh*
    syntax/                  (1)
    syntax/                  (1)
    vimoutlinerrc            (1)

(1) The content of these folders should be copied to their namesakes in the
$HOME/.vim folder

Your $HOME/.vimrc file should contain the lines

     filetype plugin indent on
     syntax on

Finally, you need to integrate the online help provided with VimOutliner into
the vim help system.  Start vim and execute the following command:

    :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc

At this point, VimOutliner should be functional.  Type ":help vo" to get
started. To get a quick overview of all VimOutliner commands you can view the 
cheatsheet with ":help votl_cheatsheet". 

Testing Base Functionality

Create a text file and save it as a .otl file like vo_test.otl. Enter
some text and verify the following:
- Tabs indent the text
- Different indent levels are different colors
- Lines starting with a colon and space word-wrap

Lines starting with colons are body text. They should word wrap and
should be a special color (typically green, but it can vary). Verify
that paragraphs of body text can be reformatted with the Vim gq
commands.

You can test the different VimOutliner commands by looking at the examples
in the cheatsheet. "help votl_cheatsheet".

Debian Installation

Debian does include VimOutliner as a package. However some Debian versions
require this line to be added to your .vimrc file:
