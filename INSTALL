Installing and Testing VimOutliner

Automatic Method

The automatic installation targets Unix-compatible platforms:

    $ tar xzvf vimoutliner-0.3.x.tar.gz
    $ cd vimoutliner
    $ sh install.sh

First you can decide whether to install the VimOutliner files or abort the
process leaving everything unchanged.  Assuming you confirmed the
installation, the script creates the necessary directory tree and copies the
files which provide the core functionality and documentation.

With the second question you decide whether you want to install some brand new
add-ons, currently implementing hoisting and checkboxes.


Updating

Updating an existing installation might require some manual work.

If you are already working with a previous VimOutliner release, there is a
slight chance that the current directory tree is different from your current
one. In this case, you will have to manually migrate your files to the new
locations.

The installation script creates unique backups of files being replaced with
newer versions. So if you put some local customisations into, say
$HOME/.vim/vimoutliner/vimoutlinerrc, you'll probably have to merge the backup
with the new file by hand.


Manual Method

You can also copy the files from the unpacked distribution tarball into their
destination folders by yourself. The following steps are a description of what
has to go where and assume some knowledge of your vim setup.

If you encounter problems, please contact the mailinglist for an immediate
solution and more complete future documentation.  www.lists.vimoutliner.org

If you want to setup VimOutliner on a system running Microsoft Windows, the
directory $HOME denotes the base folder of the vim installation.  If you're on
Unix based system, $HOME is as usual.

You need the following subtrees in your $HOME directory:

    $HOME/.vim/
        doc/
        ftdetect/
        ftplugin/
        syntax/
        vimoutliner/
            plugins/
            scripts/

The distribution tarball unpacks into a directory vimoutliner with the
following contents:

    vimoutliner/
        plugins/             (1)
        scripts/             (1)
    doc/                     (1)
    ftdetect/                (1)
    ftplugin/                (1)
    install.sh*
    syntax/                  (1)
    syntax/                  (1)
    vimoutlinerrc            (1)

(1) The content of these folders should be copied to their namesakes in the
$HOME/.vim folder

Your $HOME/.vimrc file should contain the lines

     filetype plugin indent on
     syntax on

Finally, you need to integrate the online help provided with VimOutliner into
the vim help system.  Start vim and execute the following command:

    :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc

At this point, VimOutliner should be functional.  Type ":help vo" to get
started.


Color Schemes

Color schemes specify the colors Vim Outliner uses when displaying an outline.
Colors are specified by object and level.  These objects currently include:
headings, body text, pre- formatted body text, tables and others. See
|vo-objects| for more information.

Color scheme files are located in the system-wide vim colors directory and/or
your $HOME/.vim/colors directory. You can select from any of the provided
schemes. Vim Outliner internally includes a scheme the matches vo_light.vim.

To override the default color scheme you can edit these lines in your
$HOME/.vim/vimoutline/vimoutlinerrc file:

    "Custom Colors **********************************
    " Uncomment this next line to force using VO on
    " a light background
    " colorscheme vo_light
    " Uncomment this next line to force using VO on
    " a dark background
    " colorscheme vo_dark

To create your own scheme follow these simple steps:

1. Go to your $HOME/.vim/colors directory.  If you don't have one, create it.

2. Make a copy of one of the included schemes to use as a starting point. You
   should be able to find them in places like: $HOME/.vim/colors and
   /usr/share/vim/vim63/colors. Put the copy in your own colors directory
   ($HOME/.vim/colors)

3. Edit the scheme file to change whatever colors you wish.

4. Select the scheme in your $HOME/.vim/vimoutline/vimoutlinerrc file.  The
   line should look something like this:

       colorscheme noel

That's all there is to it.


Testing Base Functionality

Open a new outline with the following:

    rm $HOME/vo_test.otl
    gvim $HOME/vo_test.otl or vim $HOME/vo_test.otl

Verify the following:
- Tabs indent the text
- Different indent levels are different colors
- Lines starting with a colon and space word-wrap

  Lines starting with colons are body text. They should word wrap and
  should be a special color (typically green, but it can vary). Verify
  that paragraphs of body text can be reformatted with the Vim gq
  commands.

Verify Interoutline Linking:

Interoutline linking currently requires a working perl installation to
generate the necessary tag file. We are looking into porting this to vim's own
scripting language.

Place the following two lines in $HOME/vo_test.otl:

    _tag_newfile
        $HOME/vo_newfile.otl

Note that in the preceding, the 2nd line should be indented from the first.

To create VimOutliner's tag file $HOME/.vim/vimoutliner/vo_tags.tag, run
vo_maketags.pl, which resides in $HOME/.vimoutliner/scripts/: $
$HOME/.vim/vimoutliner/scripts/vo_maketags.pl $HOME/vo_test.otl

Try the following:
- In $HOME/vo_test.otl
- Cursor to the _tag_newfile marker
- Press CTRL-K
    You should be brought to $HOME/vo_newfile.otl
- Press CTRL-N
    You should be brought back to $HOME/vo_test.otl
Note:
    CTRL-K is a VimOutliner synonym for CTRL-]
    CTRL-N is a VimOutliner synonym for CTRL-T


Debian Installation

Debian does include Vim Outliner as a package. However some Debian version
require this line to be added to your .vimrc file:

    syntax on
