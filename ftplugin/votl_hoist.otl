Hoisting
What is it?
	: Hoisting is a way to focus on a particular area of an outline. Only the 
	: offspring from a selected parent will be shown. The offspring are 
	: left-justified just as if they were the top level headings and had no 
	: parent.
Installation
	The hoist plugin is included in the VimOutliner plugin directory
		This plugin is disabled by default
		See information in the ~/.vimoutlinerrc on how to enable it
	Optionally set the hoistParanoia variable
		: If you are really paranoid about loosing your data during shakedown 
		: of vo_hoist.vim, you can add this to your ~/.vimoutlinerrc file. It 
		: will prevent VO from automatically removing the temporary hoist 
		: files. This will have a tendency to hugely increase the number of 
		: files in your working directory (but if you're paranoid... ;) )
		let g:hoistParanoia = 1
How do I use it?
	Hoisting
		: Whenever you open a VO document, hoisting will be available.
		Invocation
			Place the cursor on the parent to be hoisted
			,,h
			You will need to hit <ENTER> to accept some informational messages
			You should now see the children of the selected parent ready for editing
			Treat this document just like a normal .otl file
	De-hoisting
		: From within the hoisted document you simply need to quit. The 
		: hoisted data will be saved in place of the old children. The cursor 
		: will be returned to the hoisted parent.
		Invocation
			The :q, :wq, :x and ZZ  perform a de-hoist operation
			A write will automatically be done to save any changes
	Manual De-hoisting
		: Should the de-hoisting ever fail or should an operator quit Vim (by 
		: closing the window with the mouse, say), a manual de-hoisting will 
		: need to be performed.
		You can find a currently hoisted parent by searching for __hoist
		Place the cursor on the parent with the __hoist tag
		,,H
		The edited, hoisted offspring will replace the current offspring
		The __hoist tag will be removed
The Hoist Tag
	Example Tag
	: The hoist tag is added to a hoisted parent for error recovery. It 
	: includes a filename, a line number and a timestamp.
	Example Tag
		__hoist:vo_hoist.46.20030816124249.otl
	Tag Components
		Tag Marker
			__hoist:
			Easy search and replace
		Filename Prefix
			vo_hoist.
			Needed to comply with VO standards for file naming
		Parent Line Number (at time of hoisting)
			46.
		Timestamp
			20030816124249
			YYYYMMDDhhmmss
		Filename Suffix
			.otl
			Duh
The Log Files
	: Log files of the hoists are created to aid in error recovery should that 
	: become necessary. They are created in the same directory as the working 
	: .otl file.
	Log Filename
		.vo_hoist.<otlfilename>.log
	Example Log Filename
		.vo_hoist.test.otl.log
	Contents
		There is one line per hoist operation
		Each is comprised of a parent with a __hoist tag
Limitations
	1 Level Deep
		: Until debug is complete, hoisting is limited to one level.
