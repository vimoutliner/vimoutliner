VimOutliner is an outline processor with many of the same features
as Grandview, More, Thinktank, Ecco, etc. Features include tree
expand/collapse, tree promotion/demotion, level sensitive colors,
interoutline linking, and body text.

What sets VimOutliner apart from the rest is that it's been constructed
from the ground up for fast and easy authoring.  Keystrokes are quick and
easy, especially for someone knowing the Vim editor. VimOutliner can be
used without the mouse (but is supported to the extent that Vim supports
the mouse). 

Many of the VimOutliner commands start with a double comma ",,"
because that's very quick to type. All VimOutliner files have the ".otl"
extension. For an overview of the VimOutliner commands you can type ":h
vo_cheatsheet" when you have opened an otl file. For help on VimOutliner
type ":h vo".
